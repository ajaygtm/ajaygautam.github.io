# About Ajay Gautam

I’m a **Senior Data Scientist** who’s been building ML, NLP, and CV systems for a little over 7 years. Along the way, I picked up the **AWS Machine Learning Specialty** badge, worked across healthcare, banking, supply chain, retail, and insurance, solving problems from predicting patient outcomes to optimizing retail operations.  

These days, I spend my time leading a team, playing around with GenAI, RAG, and ML pipelines, and making sure the things I build don’t just stay in notebooks but actually run in production.  

### Currently

- Diving into ML rabbit holes (the fun kind, mostly)  
- Staying up-to-date on GenAI (not as easy as it sounds)  
- Building stuff I like (sometimes it turns out pretty cool)  
- Reading and exploring ethical AI
